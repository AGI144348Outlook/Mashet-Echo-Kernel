# Mashet — Structural Coherence Kernel

Mashet is a phase-gated structural kernel designed to enforce coherence,
non-contradiction, and auditability prior to the introduction of semantics,
interpretation, or dynamic behavior.

It is not a simulation, language model, or agent system.
It is a constraint-first substrate for lawful symbolic emergence.

---

## Design Principle

Meaning is not a primitive.

Mashet enforces structure, jurisdiction, and permission *before* any
interpretive or expressive layer is allowed to exist. Semantic effects, if
they arise, are downstream artifacts of constrained structure.

## Current Status

**Active Phase:** Phase 2 — Structural Law

Completed:
- Phase 1: Identity
- Phase 2A-I: Structural Capacity (inert carriers)
- Phase 2A-II: Structural Invariants (shape law)

Not yet implemented:
- Phase 2B-I: Inert Symbol Substrates
- Phase 2B-II: Jurisdictional Tokens
- Phase 3: Binding & Controlled Recursion
- Phase 4: Environments
- Phase 5: Dynamics

---

## What This System Explicitly Does NOT Do

- No semantic interpretation
- No translation or meaning assignment
- No agents or autonomous entities
- No simulation or world modeling
- No learning or prediction
- No claims of consciousness or sentience

Any appearance of meaning or agency is treated as a downstream,
non-primitive phenomenon and is outside the scope of the kernel.

## Architectural Overview

Mashet is built in strictly ordered layers:

1. **Identity**
   - Genesis, manifest, immutability seal

2. **Structural Capacity**
   - Inert carriers (scalar, vector, matrix, point)
   - No values, no operations

3. **Structural Invariants**
   - Cardinality rules
   - Containment constraints
   - Composition limits
   - Reference prohibitions
   - Phase-order enforcement

Later phases introduce symbols, permissions, and environments only after
structural legality is proven.

---

## Coherence & Auditability

Mashet is designed to pass coherence-based audits by ensuring:

- Explicit phase gating
- Hard prohibition of premature semantics
- Non-recursive foundations
- Traceable transformation boundaries
- Clear separation between structure and interpretation

The kernel is allowed to refuse illegal constructions.
This refusal is a feature, not a failure.

---

## Intended Use

Mashet may be used as:
- A symbolic substrate for constrained generative systems
- A coherence-preserving foundation for multi-domain representations
- A research kernel for studying emergence under structural law

It is not intended as an end-user application.

## License & Scope

This repository defines a kernel only.
Any higher-layer systems must respect phase boundaries and invariants
defined herein.


Certain subject-capable anchors are instantiated together with a fixed set of bound object substrates.
The spatial orientation of this constellation encodes jurisdictional flow constraints.
These bindings do not perform actions but establish ownership and eligibility.
A subject anchor becomes operational only after a Phase 5 dynamic initialization sequence binds an authorized verbal operator set within a valid environment.
